# OpenGL_project
I wanted to learn OpenGL just because, too much python recently, back to the origin.
Right now this is still a big WIP. Maybe in the future there will be something to see.

## Resources
I'm mainly following [this playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_POT8K638VY&list=PLysLvOneEETPlOI_PI4mJnocqIpr2cSHS&index=2) 
and [learnopengl](https://learnopengl.com/) to learn the basics. I've also left comments in the code as notes, so they
can be useful to someone.

## SW requirements
I'm working on Ubuntu 22.04
