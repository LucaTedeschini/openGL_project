You have a shader program, composed by a vertex shader and a fragment shader.
All of that can be called a Vertex Array Object (VAO). Basically a wrapper that get passed to the GPU.
So this VAO is basically a box that point to datas. VAO stores Vertex Buffer Object (VBO)
VBO is a vector of vertices
v[0] v[1] ... v[n]

A VBO binds to a VAO

Kinda complex, need to read more
